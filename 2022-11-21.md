`Statics, T0803`
Block 8a, 8b is covered.


To know how much load a structure will carry, one needs to know:
- Internal load of a structure:
	- Normal forces $N$
	- Torsion force $T_x$
	- Bending moments $M_x,M_z$
	- $V_z,V_y$
- Material properties
- Geometry

Deformation needs to be also taken into account when considering material properties

| Load | Stress | Deformation |
| -----| ------ | --------------- |
| $N_x$ | $\sigma_x = \frac{N_x}{A}$<br> valid for uniform distribution stress |
| $T_x$ |  | | 
| $M_y,M_z$ | | 
| $V_y, V_z$ | $\begin{matrix}\tau_{xz} = \frac{V_z}{A} \\ \tau_{xy} = \frac{V_y}{A}\end{matrix}$<br> assume uniform distribution<br>this is not theoretically correct, never uniform distrib<br>we are however allowed to use this on the exam | 

Internal loading of a potato: we know all external and reaction forces, we cut the potato into half, and replace the load applied by one half with a normal force, torsion moment, shear force, bending moment.
As many cuts as needed can be made until we get a finite element structure. 

He abbreviates a moment as two opposite forces given enough cuts, bending and shear forces will arise as a result of reaction forces between elements, which means the moment information is encoded within the forces.

$\sigma$  are normal forces.
$$
\sigma_i = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0}\left(\frac{N_i}{A}\right) \mid i\in\{x,y,z\}
$$
$\tau$ are shear froces.
$$
\begin{matrix}
\tau_{zx} = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0}\frac{V_{x,z}}{A}\\
\tau_{zy} = \lim_{A\rightarrow 0}\frac{V_{y,z}}{A}
\end{matrix}
$$
There are 18 different forces to cause stress, as this is too much we relate some of the forces to each other.

$\Sigma F_x=0 \Rightarrow \sigma_x*A - \sigma_x' * A = 0$
$\Sigma F_y=0 \Rightarrow \sigma_y = \sigma_y'$
$\tau_{yx}=\tau_{yx}'$
$\tau_{xy}=\tau_{xy}'$

$\Sigma M_{z,o}=0$
$+\tau_{xy}*A*d-\tau_{yx}*A*d \Rightarrow \tau_{xy}=\tau{yx}$

Thus, we have reduced all variables to 6: $\sigma_{x,y,z}, \tau_{xy}, \tau_{xz}, \tau_{yz}$

When there are uncertainties in material properties and dimensions and shapes used, we introduce safety factors to make sure the structure will hold.
$$\frac{\sigma_{\textrm{max}}}{\gamma_{\textrm{material}}} \ge \gamma_{\textrm{load}} * \frac{N}{A}$$

$\gamma_{\textrm{material}}$ is a standard value given to you.
$\gamma_{\textrm{load}}$ depends on application, designer will decide.

Differnet types of analysies:
1. max load $\sigma_{\textrm{max}}$, force $N$, area $A$ are known.<br>here, we just check if it is strong enough.
2. max load $\sigma_{\textrm{max}}$, area $A$ are known; force $N$ is unknowm.<br> calculate the max load the structure can bear.
3. max load $\sigma_{\textrm{max}}$, force $N$ are known; area $A$ is unknown.<br>dimensioning problem, most commonly faced problem.
4. force $N$, area $A$ are known; max load $\sigma_{\textrm{max}}$ is unknown<br>material selection
